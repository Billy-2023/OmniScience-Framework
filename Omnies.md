# The OmniScience (OMNIE) Registry

Welcome to the OmniScience Universe. This is the canonical registry of all **OmniScience** domain repositories (each referred to as an **OMNIE**).

**The core framework, contribution guidelines, and project philosophy are defined in the [OmniScience Framework](../) repository. Please start there.**

## 📚 What is an OMNIE?

An **OMNIE** is a dedicated, open-source repository that provides a **deep, comprehensive, and structured explanation** of a single, complex domain (e.g., the Internet, Quantum Mechanics). All OMNIE repositories follow the same core principles and templates defined in the parent framework.

## 🗺️ The OMNIE Landscape

Below is the list of all active and planned OMNIE projects. The status indicates their development phase.

| Status | OMNIE (Repository) | Short Description | Lead Maintainer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🚧 **Active** | **[Internet Explained](https://github.com/Billy-2023/OmniScience-Internet-Explained)** | A deep dive into how the Internet works, from packets to society. | [@Billy-2023](https://github.com/Billy-2023) |
| 📅 *Planned* | *Quantum Mechanics Explained* | From wave functions to interpretations. | *Seeking Guardian* |
| 📅 *Planned* | *Monetary Systems Explained* | From shells to cryptocurrencies. | *Seeking Guardian* |
| 📅 *Planned* | *Climate Science Explained* | The physics, models, and data of Earth's climate. | *Seeking Guardian* |
| 💡 *Idea* | *Consciousness Explained* | *Proposal stage* | *N/A* |

**Status Key:**
- **🚧 Active**: Repository exists, content is being written and reviewed.
- **📅 Planned**: Domain is approved; repository creation is pending a founding contributor or expert guardian.
- **💡 Idea**: Proposed domain awaiting formalization via a [Domain Proposal](../TEMPLATES/DOMAIN_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md).

## 🚀 Start Here: The Main Hub

All OMNIE projects are governed by and contribute to a shared vision. Your journey should begin at the central hub:

### **[OmniScience Framework](https://github.com/Billy-2023/OmniScience-Framework)**
This is the **constitution** of the entire project. Here you will find:
*   The **project vision and principles**.
*   The canonical **Article Template** for writing.
*   The **Contribution Guide** for all contributors.
*   Policies on **AI usage** and collaboration.
*   The process for **proposing a new OMNIE**.

**If you are new, go here first.**

## 🔗 How Are OMNIE Projects Connected?

1.  **Shared Framework**: All use the same templates and quality standards.
2.  **Cross-References**: Articles in one OMNIE explicitly link to related concepts in other OMNIE repositories, building a knowledge graph.
3.  **Shared Community**: Discussion, peer review, and governance often span across projects.

---

## 🤝 How to Engage

*   **To Read and Learn**: Explore any Active OMNIE repository from the table above.
*   **To Contribute (Write/Edit)**: Go to the specific Active OMNIE repository and follow its `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide, which points back to the main Framework.
*   **To Propose a New Domain**: Use the [Domain Proposal Template](../TEMPLATES/DOMAIN_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md) in the main Framework repository.
*   **To Become a Domain Expert (Guardian)**: We need scholars and practitioners to guide content. Express interest via **billy_1024@outlook.com**.

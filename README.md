# OmniScience

## The Open, Deep, and Connected Universe of Knowledge

**OmniScience** is an ambitious, open-source initiative with a singular purpose: to create **authoritative, comprehensive, and deeply interconnected explanations** for every significant concept, technology, and phenomenon that shapes our world—from the fundamentals of the **Internet** to the principles of **Quantum Mechanics**.

We are not building another encyclopedia.

### How We Are Different

Unlike Wikipedia or other reference sites that provide broad, summary-level overviews, OmniScience is dedicated to **depth over breadth**. Each topic is treated not as an isolated entry, but as a chapter in a grand, unified narrative of understanding. We delve into the *why* and the *how*, tracing historical context, exploring fundamental principles, and connecting ideas across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Our goal is to create not a collection of articles, but a living, navigable **knowledge graph**.

### Our Invitation

#### For Domain Experts & Scholars
We are building a community grounded in accuracy and intellectual rigor. If you are a scholar, researcher, engineer, or practitioner with deep expertise in any field, your insight is invaluable.

**We invite you to become a Domain Guardian.**
As a Guardian, you will help guide and review content within your area of expertise, ensuring its depth and correctness. To express your interest, please email: **billy_1024@outlook.com**.

#### For Contributors & Lifelong Learners
OmniScience is built by and for the global community of the curious. Whether you are a student, a professional, or an autodidact, you are welcome here.

**We invite you to write, edit, discuss, and learn with us.**
Start by exploring an existing topic, propose a clarification, or draft a new connection. Follow our ./CONTRIBUTING.md to begin. This is a collaborative journey in learning and teaching.

### Language & Translation

Our **official language of collaboration is English** to maintain a unified, global workflow for core development. However, we enthusiastically welcome and support volunteer efforts to translate this knowledge into every language. Translated versions will be linked from the primary English content, making deep understanding accessible to all.

### Our Stance on AI

We embrace modern tools, including artificial intelligence, as powerful assistants for brainstorming, drafting, and refining text. **However, AI is a collaborator, not an authority.** All factual claims, logical reasoning, and final editorial control rest with human contributors. AI-assisted content must be clearly disclosed and is subject to the same rigorous verification and peer-review process as any other contribution.

### Join the Journey

This project begins with a simple but profound belief: **deep understanding should be open, connectable, and perpetually refined by everyone.**

We are starting with the first foundational concepts. The framework is ready, and the first repository awaits its initial content. From this seed, we will grow an entire universe of knowledge, together.

**We look forward to building this with you.**
